# RiKUS

this is me trolling all the vim-fanatics out there: A shortcut on your desktop
that starts a terminal emulator (like xterm, urxvt), but accually iz <del>Dolan</del> Emacs.

After talking about it on IRC I realised some might find this actually useful so
I won't keep it to myself.

What it does: Starts an "Emacs -Q" with nothing but an \*ansi-term\* buffer visible, no toolbars, no scrollbars, no mode-line, etc

Documentation: there is none, and I don't think there ever will be

Usage: look at the .sh script, make your changes as you see fit, if needed do a "chmod +x", execute
